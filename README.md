Basic usage:

-The script "training_test.py" is meant to train the network. Most parameters can be customized there.
-The script "reconstruction_test.py" is meant to load a pre-trained network (which is, by default, the file "sky_voice_net.pt" located in the /outputs folder). 
This selects a random sample from the reduced dataset and forwards it through the network. Input speech and melody, as well as predicted spectrogram and comparison of energies, are shown.
